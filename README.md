# collapsar-club-express

a simple express assignment to create a basic booking site for a restaurant/club
that can receive get and post requests to an express server, adding reservations to tables
and a waiting list and returning the up-to-date info to the client, using jQuery to update
the html views

practice only; most of this code is taken straight from the assignment walkthrough. A useful and
heavily-commented exercise in learning about express.js and the Model-View-Controller pattern
used by fullstack apps.
